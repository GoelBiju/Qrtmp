""" Quick RTMP connection client """


# Info:
# Credits:

# Structure:
# Predominantly consisting of a class structure with 3 main classes:
#       - Pre-connection settings
#       - Normal packet handling via NetConnection
#       - Other packet handling via NetStream


# AMF Encoding/Decoding:
# The process of encoding or decoding AMF formats should be done via PyAMF/AMFast - both of which
# are supported in the amfast library.


# Pre-connection:
# 1. Should handle all the necessary processes to establish a connection between client and server
# all before the exchange of whatever standard of formats has begun.

# NetConnection:
# 1. Should have all the procedures necessary to establish the initial connection to a server.
# Including handshake & connection packet.
